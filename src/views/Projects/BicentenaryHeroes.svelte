	<p>
	Bicentenary Heroes is a decision-making game set in the 19th century, 
	a crucial period in Colombia's independence process. In a group or alone,
	the user plays the role of a <b>libertarian army member</b> in charge of achieving
	Colombia's elusive quest for freedom. Each mission, inspired by the real-life path
	to independence, presents players with challenging choices related to 4 themes.
	If one of these components is <b>out of balance</b>, the game will progressively lead
	the player to an uncertain end.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	Along the way, the user can share experiences and bits of advice with famous
	historical characters related to the indigenous communities, pro-independence
	foreign collaborators, and Afro-communities, all of which are essential in the
	independence race.

	To create the narrative, a team of experts worked with designers to 
	reconstruct historical events, drawing inspiration from the game <b>'Reigns'</b>.
	In this game, decisions are made by swiping cards to the <b>left or right</b>, 
	thus changing the future of the character. In this way, a number of
	different storylines, some with good and bad outcomes for the Independence
	Movement, were developed by referencing <b>historical events and real-life characters</b>.
