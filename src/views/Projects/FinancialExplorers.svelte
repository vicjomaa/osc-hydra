	When developing an educational game, it's important to align it with the educational
	objectives to ensure that it teaches relevant skills or content. As part of the design
	decision, exploration led to an aesthetic that could <b>prioritise the blocks of information</b>
	and visual cues that could facilitate the reading of the information. This led to the
	consideration of flat design as a strategy to focus attention on the most important
	blocks of information, complemented by a pastel colour palette compatible with the
	<b>client's brand guidelines</b>. This was also used as a cue to highlight relevant components
	that maintained the flow of the interaction.

	match blocks of information with the context were used. Such as mechanics like ike <b>drag and drop</b>, complete
	the sentence, and choose the correct answer, and <b>swiping cards</b> for taking decision. This also considered 
	the background knowledge of the participants, and the time available for the experience.
